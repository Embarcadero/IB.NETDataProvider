Changes for 1.0.0.0 

  General - 
	  All class names and name spaces are changed to be IB vs Fb or Fes.  This was done so that both the Fb driver and this driver it is based on will not have any naming conflicts if both used in the same application.

  Common 
    Namespaces changed from FirebirdSql.VisualStudio.DataTools to InterBaseSQL.VisualStudio.DataTools
		Use the IB named versions of classes and variable names where appropriate moved from fb to ib prefixes.
